Instead of continuing to follow the same file-naming pattern we used
previously, we can do what the note suggests:
1.
2.
3.
Make a new directory named network, the parent moduleâ€™s name.
Move the src/network.rs file into the new network directory and rename it
src/network/mod.rs.
Move the submodule file src/server.rs into the network directory.
Here are commands to carry out these steps:
$ mkdir src/network
$ mv src/network.rs src/network/mod.rs
$ mv src/server.rs src/network
